# Algorithms
This is for me to organize and parctice the basic search and sort algorithms.

## Structure
Contains two main directories: ``Search`` and ``Sort``

``search``
- binary.py
    - contains python code for a simple binary search algorithm
- linear.py
    - contains python code for a simple linear search algorithm
- O1.py
    - contains python code for a simple O(1) search algorithm
- playground.py
    - an environment for me to practice writing algorithms
